Instructions for Using Git, Github, and Visual Studio Code

1. Create a repository on Github (include readme.md and .gitignore)
2. Clone the repository (copy the string of text that github provides for your repository)
3. Download Gitbash and open a GitBash terminal
4. Navigate to your folder of choice using the "cd" command
5. Use the command "git clone [paste the clondes repository]"
6. Download and open VSC
7. Open the project folder (the folder you have placed your gloned repository in)
8. BEGIN CODING! (Occasionally save your work!!!)
9. Open a Gitbash terminal
10. Navigate to the GIT repository
11. Check your status using "git status"
12. To add your files to be commited use "git add --all"
13. Check your status again to make sure all files have been added
14. Commit your changes with "git commit -am '[commit message]' "
15. To change your branch from master and save in a new branch to keep any incoming changes from overwriting your main branch, use "git checkout -b [new-branch-name]" (make sure you have no spaces within the new branch name)
16. You can also save in an existing branch using "git checkout [name-of-branch]"
17. Make sure to push your commits with "git push origin [branch-name]"
18. To pull from a branch from the repository, use "git pull [branch-name]"

1. Branch - a version of the project that is saved within the repository
2. Clone - to make a copy of a repository
3. Commit - saving the changes within the project that are within your local repository
4. Fetch - a command that downloads commits, files and refs from a remote repository
5. GIT - the most common version-control system that can be used to work, save and collaborate on projects
6. Github - the website that makes using git much easier
7. Merge - taking a branch from a repository and adding its changes to another repository
8. Merge Conflict - it is an error that happens when git isnt able to automatically resolve the differences in code between two commits
9. Push - a command that allows you to add the saved changes into the branch of your remote repository
10. Pull - a command that takes the files, refs and commits and adds them into your local repository
11. Remote - a git repository hosted on the internet or another network
12. Repository - a place where the entire project including all of its accessable versions are kept
